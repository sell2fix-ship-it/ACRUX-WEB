## Logo Instructions

To add the Acrux Trust, Inc. logo:

1. Visit the web archive URL: https://web.archive.org/web/20250223104619/https://acruxtrust.com/
2. Find the "ACRUX WORD LOGO" image on the archived page
3. Right-click on the logo image and save it
4. Save it as `logo.png` in this `assets` folder
5. The logo should be:
   - PNG format (or SVG if available)
   - Transparent background preferred
   - High resolution (at least 200px wide for best quality)

The website is already configured to use `assets/logo.png` - just place the logo file here and it will automatically appear in the header.

## Alternative: Using a Text Logo

If you cannot access the logo from the archive, you can:
- Create a simple text-based logo using CSS
- Use a logo generator tool
- Contact Acrux Trust, Inc. for the official logo file
