## How to Add the BBB A+ Rating Logo

### Option 1: Download Official BBB Logo (Recommended)

1. **Get the Official BBB Logo:**
   - Visit your BBB profile: https://www.bbb.org/us/fl/coral-gables/profile/real-estate-investing/acrux-trust-inc-0633-92034371
   - Log in to your BBB business account
   - Navigate to "Get Your Seal" or "Widgets" section
   - Download the official A+ Rating badge/logo

2. **Save the Logo:**
   - Save the logo file as `bbb-aplus-rating.png` in the `assets` folder
   - Recommended sizes:
     - Header: 120px wide
     - Benefits section: 200px wide
     - Footer: 150px wide
   - Format: PNG with transparent background (preferred) or JPG

### Option 2: Use BBB Widget Code (Works Immediately)

1. **Get BBB Widget Code:**
   - Visit: https://www.bbb.org/get-accredited/bbb-widgets
   - Or log into your BBB account and go to the widgets section
   - Copy the widget code for your business

2. **Replace Image Tags:**
   - The widget code will include an `<img>` tag or `<script>` tag
   - Replace the current `<img>` tags in the HTML with the BBB widget code
   - The widget will automatically display your current rating

## Current Placement

The BBB logo has been added in three locations:
1. **Header (Top of Page)** - Next to the Acrux Trust logo
2. **Benefits Section** - Above the "Why Choose Acrux Trust, Inc." benefits grid
3. **Footer** - In the footer bottom section above the copyright

All links point to: https://www.bbb.org/us/fl/coral-gables/profile/real-estate-investing/acrux-trust-inc-0633-92034371

## File Location

Place your BBB logo file at:
`assets/bbb-aplus-rating.png`

## Quick Fix for Logo Not Loading

If the logo isn't showing:
1. Check that the file is named exactly: `bbb-aplus-rating.png`
2. Verify the file is in the `assets` folder
3. Try using the BBB widget code instead (Option 2 above)
4. Check browser console for any error messages

## Note

Make sure you have permission to use the BBB logo and that your business is actually accredited with an A+ rating. Using the logo without proper accreditation may violate BBB guidelines.
